# Statistics

I use this repo for stats projects. I'm learning how to model situations I encounter in daily life to understand the probabilities involved. Both are in Jupyter Notebooks. 

Population groups exclusion:
Before I worked in python I tried calculating these probabilities long hand. Turns out calculating probabilities across populations is really hard. 
This really simple model simulates taking a random sample of a diverse population group. I've chosen one characteristic- this could be a protected characteristic or a care need. 
This demonstrates that it's very likely we will accidentally exclude a minority group unless we introduce a technique to control for this such as stratified random sampling. 

Yoyo Bears
I was just curious after watching my daughter trying to complete her Yoyo Bears card collection. Thanks to coronavirus, swapsies are discouraged at school. 
The duplicates pile was as big as the collection pile. Which got me thinking, what are the expectations for how long this can take to complete. 
I used a very similar technique to model a deck of cards as a list of size n, where 1/0 = card present/missing. 
The notebook demonstrates that completing a card collection without swaps is far harder than children appreciate. 
On a happy note, my daughter has used this model (well, a brief overview of its findings) to justify selling duplicates for inflated prices.
